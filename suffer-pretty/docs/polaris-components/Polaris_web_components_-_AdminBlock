# Admin​Block

`s-admin-block` provides a deeper integration with the container your UI is rendered into. This component should only be used in Block Extensions, which render inline on a resource page.

## Properties

* collapsedSummary

  string

  The summary to display when the app block is collapsed. Summary longer than 30 characters will be truncated.

* heading

  string

  The text to use as the Block title in the block header. If not provided, the name of the extension will be used.

### Examples

  ##### jsx

  ```jsx
  <s-admin-block title="My App Block">5 items active</s-admin-block>;
  ```

## Considerations

* Initial height is limited to 300px.
* When content exceeds the height limit, a "Show more" button appears.
* In development, the following warning also displays: "Warning! This Block is too tall."
* After expanding to the max height, content that exceeds the limit is cut off, and the merchant must navigate to the extension's app via the provided link.
