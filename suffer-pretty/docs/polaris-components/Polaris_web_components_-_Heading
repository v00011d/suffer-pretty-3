# Heading

Renders hierarchical titles to communicate the structure and organization of page content. Heading levels adjust automatically based on nesting within parent Section components, ensuring a meaningful and accessible page outline.

## Properties

* accessibilityRole

  "none" | "presentation" | "heading"

  Default: 'heading'

  Sets the semantic meaning of the component’s content. When set, the role will be used by assistive technologies to help users navigate the page.

  * `heading`: defines the element as a heading to a page or section.
  * `presentation`: the heading level will be stripped, and will prevent the element’s implicit ARIA semantics from being exposed to the accessibility tree.
  * `none`: a synonym for the `presentation` role.

* accessibilityVisibility

  "visible" | "hidden" | "exclusive"

  Default: 'visible'

  Changes the visibility of the element.

  * `visible`: the element is visible to all users.
  * `hidden`: the element is removed from the accessibility tree but remains visible.
  * `exclusive`: the element is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

* lineClamp

  number

  Default: Infinity - no truncation is applied

  Truncates the text content to the specified number of lines.

## Slots

* children

  HTMLElement

  The content of the Heading.

### Examples

* #### Code

  ##### jsx

  ```jsx
  <s-heading>Online store dashboard</s-heading>
  ```

  ##### html

  ```html
  <s-heading>Online store dashboard</s-heading>
  ```

## Useful for

* Creating titles and subtitles for your content that are consistent across your app.
* Helping users with visual impairments navigate through content effectively using assistive technologies like screen readers.

## Considerations

* The level of the heading is automatically determined by how deeply it's nested inside other components, starting from h2.
* Default to using the `heading` property in `s-section`. The `s-heading` component should only be used if you need to implement a custom layout for your heading in the UI.

## Best practices

* Use short headings to make your content scannable.
* Use plain and clear terms.
* Don't use jargon or technical language.
* Don't use different terms to describe the same thing.
* Don't duplicate content.

## Examples

Component examples

### Basic usage

Basic heading

Standard heading for section titles and page content organization that creates a simple, clean title for a content section.

Heading with line clamping

Truncated heading that limits text to a specified number of lines, using ellipsis to indicate additional content for long product names or constrained layouts.

Heading with custom accessibility

Heading configured with custom ARIA roles and visibility settings to meet specific accessibility requirements or design constraints.

Heading within section hierarchy

Demonstrates nested heading structure that automatically adjusts heading levels (h2, h3, h4) based on the current section depth, ensuring proper semantic document structure.
