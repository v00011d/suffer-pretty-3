# Number​Field

This component is specifically designed for numeric data entry.

## NumberFieldProps

* label

  string

  required

  Content to use as the field label.

* autocomplete

  \| AutocompleteField | \`${AutocompleteSection} ${AutocompleteField}\` | \`${AutocompleteGroup} ${AutocompleteField}\` | \`${AutocompleteSection} ${AutocompleteGroup} ${AutocompleteField}\` | boolean

  A hint as to the intended content of the field.

  When set to `true`, this property indicates that the field should support autofill, but you do not have any more semantic information on the intended contents.

  When set to `false`, you are indicating that this field contains sensitive information, or contents that are never saved, like one-time codes.

  Alternatively, you can provide value which describes the specific data you would like to be entered into this field during autofill.

* defaultValue

  string | string\[]

  A default value to populate for uncontrolled components.

* disabled

  boolean

  Whether the field can be modified.

* error

  string

  Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.

* id

  string

  A unique identifier for the field.

* inputMode

  'decimal' | 'numeric'

  Default: 'decimal'

  Sets the virtual keyboard.

* max

  number

  The highest decimal or integer to be accepted for the field. When used with `step` the value will round down to the max number.

  Note: a user will still be able to use the keyboard to input a number higher than the max. It is up to the developer to add appropriate validation.

* min

  number

  Default: 0

  The lowest decimal or integer to be accepted for the field. When used with `step` the value will round up to the min number.

  Note: a user will still be able to use the keyboard to input a number lower than the min. It is up to the developer to add appropriate validation.

* name

  string

  An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing `Form` component.

* onBlur

  () => void

  Callback when focus is removed.

* onChange

  (value: number) => void

  Callback when the user has **finished editing** a field. Unlike `onChange` callbacks you may be familiar with from React component libraries, this callback is **not** run on every change to the input. Text fields are “partially controlled” components, which means that while the user edits the field, its state is controlled by the component. Once the user has signalled that they have finished editing the field (typically, by blurring the field), `onChange` is called if the input actually changed from the most recent `value` property. At that point, you are expected to store this “committed value” in state, and reflect it in the text field’s `value` property.

  This state management model is important given how UI Extensions are rendered. UI Extension components run on a separate thread from the UI, so they can’t respond to input synchronously. A pattern popularized by [controlled React components](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) is to have the component be the source of truth for the input `value`, and update the `value` on every user input. The delay in responding to events from a UI extension is only a few milliseconds, but attempting to strictly store state with this delay can cause issues if a user types quickly, or if the user is using a lower-powered device. Having the UI thread take ownership for “in progress” input, and only synchronizing when the user is finished with a field, avoids this risk.

  It can still sometimes be useful to be notified when the user makes any input in the field. If you need this capability, you can use the `onInput` prop. However, never use that property to create tightly controlled state for the `value`.

  This callback is called with the current value of the field. If the value of a field is the same as the current `value` prop provided to the field, the `onChange` callback will not be run.

* onFocus

  () => void

  Callback when input is focused.

* onInput

  (value: number) => void

  Callback when the user makes any changes in the field. As noted in the documentation for `onChange`, you **must not** use this to update `value` — use the `onChange` callback for that purpose. Use the `onInput` prop when you need to do something as soon as the user makes a change, like clearing validation errors that apply to the field as soon as the user begins making the necessary adjustments.

  This callback is called with the current value of the field.

* placeholder

  string

  A short hint that describes the expected value of the field.

* readOnly

  boolean

  Whether the field is read-only.

* required

  boolean

  Whether the field needs a value. This requirement adds semantic value to the field, but it will not cause an error to appear automatically. If you want to present an error when this field is empty, you can do so with the `error` prop.

* step

  number

  Default: 1

  The amount the value can increase or decrease by. This can be an integer or decimal. If a `max` or `min` is specified with `step` when increasing/decreasing the value via the buttons, the final value will always round to the `max` or `min` rather than the closest valid amount.

* suffix

  string

  Default: ''

  A value to be displayed immediately after the editable portion of the field.

  This is useful for displaying an implied part of the value, such as "@shopify.com", or "%".

  This cannot be edited by the user, and it isn't included in the value of the field.

  It may not be displayed until the user has interacted with the input. For example, an inline label may take the place of the suffix until the user focuses the input.

* value

  T

  The current value for the field. If omitted, the field will be empty. You should update this value in response to the `onChange` callback.

### AutocompleteSection

The “section” scopes the autocomplete data that should be inserted to a specific area of the page. Commonly used when there are multiple fields with the same autocomplete needs in the same page. For example: 2 shipping address forms in the same page.

```ts
`section-${string}`
```

### AutocompleteGroup

The contact information group the autocomplete data should be sourced from.

```ts
'shipping' | 'billing'
```

### Examples

* #### Simple NumberField example

  ##### React

  ```tsx
  import {render, NumberField} from '@shopify/ui-extensions-react/admin';

  render('Playground', () => <App />);

  function App() {
    return <NumberField label="Enter a discount amount" />;
  }
  ```

  ##### JS

  ```js
  import {extend, NumberField} from '@shopify/ui-extensions/admin';

  extend('Playground', (root) => {
    const discountField = root.createComponent(NumberField, {
      label: 'Enter the discount amount',
    });

    root.appendChild(discountField);
  });
  ```
