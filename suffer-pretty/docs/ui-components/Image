# Image

Use this when you want to display an image.

## ImageProps

`(ImageAccessibilityLabelProp | ImageAltProp) & (ImageSourceProp | ImageSrcProp) & ImageBaseProps`

### ImageAccessibilityLabelProp

* accessibilityLabel

  string

  Default: \`''\`

  required

  An alternative text description that describe the image for the reader to understand what it is about. It is extremely useful for both users using assistive technology and sighted users. A well written `description` provides people with visual impairments the ability to participate in consuming non-text content. When a screen readers encounters an `Image`, the description is read and announced aloud. If an image fails to load, potentially due to a poor connection, the `description` is displayed on screen instead. This has the benefit of letting a sighted user know an image was meant to load here, but as an alternative, they’re still able to consume the text content. Read [considerations when writing alternative text](https://ux.shopify.com/considerations-when-writing-alt-text-a9c1985a8204) to learn more.

  An `alt` property is available as an alias for this for compatibility with the HTML specification. When both are specified, `accessibilityLabel` takes precedence.
