# Checkbox

Use this component when you want to provide users with a clear selection option, such as for agreeing to terms and conditions or selecting multiple options from a list.

## CheckboxProps

* accessibilityLabel

  string

  A label that describes the purpose or contents of the element. When set, it will be announced to users using assistive technologies and will provide them with more context. When set, any children or `label` supplied will not be announced to screen readers.

* checked

  boolean

  Whether the checkbox is active.

* disabled

  boolean

  Whether the checkbox can be changed.

* error

  string

  Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.

* id

  string

  A unique identifier for the field. When no `id` is set, a globally unique value will be used instead.

* label

  string

  Visual content to use as the checkbox label.

* name

  string

  An identifier for the checkbox that is unique within the nearest containing `Form` component.

* onChange

  (value: boolean) => void

  A callback that is run whenever the checkbox is changed. This callback is called with a boolean indicating whether the checkbox should now be active or inactive. This component is [controlled](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components), so you must store this value in state and reflect it back in the `checked` or `value` props.

* value

  boolean

  Whether the checkbox is active. This prop is an alias for `checked`, and can be useful in form libraries that provide a normalized API for dealing with both `boolean` and `string` values. If both `value` and `checked` are set, `checked` takes precedence.

### Examples

* #### Add a simple Checkbox

  ##### React

  ```tsx
  import {render, Checkbox} from '@shopify/ui-extensions-react/admin';

  render('Playground', () => <App />);

  function App() {
    return (
      <Checkbox id="checkbox" name="checkbox">
        Save this information for next time
      </Checkbox>
    );
  }
  ```

  ##### JS

  ```js
  import {extend, Checkbox} from '@shopify/ui-extensions/admin';

  extend('Playground', (root) => {
    const checkbox = root.createComponent(
      Checkbox,
      {id: 'checkbox', name: 'checkbox'},
      'Save this information for next time',
    );

    root.appendChild(checkbox);
  });
  ```
