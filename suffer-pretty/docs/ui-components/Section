# Section

`Section` is a structural component that allows thematic grouping of content. Its visual style is contextual and controlled by Shopify, so a `Section` may look different depending on the component it is nested inside.

`Section` also automatically increases the heading level for its content to ensure a semantically correct heading structure in the document. To further increase the heading level inside the `Section`, consider nesting new `Section`s.

## SectionProps

* accessibilityLabel

  string

  A label used to describe the section that will be announced by assistive technologies.

  When no `heading` property is provided or included as a children of the Section, you **must** provide an `accessibilityLabel` to describe the Section. This is important as it allows assistive technologies to provide the right context to users.

* heading

  string

  A title that describes the content of the section.

* padding

  'base' | 'none'

  Default: "base"

  Adjust the padding of all edges.

  `base`: applies padding that is appropriate for the element. Note that it may result in no padding if Shopify believes this is the right design decision in a particular context.

  `none`: removes all padding from the element. This can be useful when elements inside the Section need to span to the edge of the Section. For example, a full-width image. In this case, rely on `Box` or any other layout element to bring back the desired padding for the rest of the content.

### Examples

* #### Section to an app page

  ##### React

  ```tsx
  import React from 'react';
  import {
    render,
    Section,
  } from '@shopify/ui-extensions-react/admin';


  render('Playground', () => <App />);

  function App() {
    return (
      <Section heading="Section heading">
        Section content
      </Section>
    );
  }
  ```

  ##### JS

  ```js
  import {
    extend,
    Section,
  } from '@shopify/ui-extensions/admin';

  export default extend(
    'Playground',
    (root) => {
      const section = root.createComponent(
        Section,
        {
          heading: 'Section heading',
        },
        'Section content'
      );

      root.appendChild(section);
    },
  );
  ```
