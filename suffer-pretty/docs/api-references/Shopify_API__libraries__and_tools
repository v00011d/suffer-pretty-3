## App templates

The following templates can help you start your Shopify app development.

When you scaffold an app using [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/cli-for-apps), you can specify the template that you want to use with the `--flavor` flag. Enter `reactRouter`, `node`, or `ruby` to use one of our app templates, or use a third-party template by providing a path to a GitHub repository for the template.

Shopify recommends using the React Router template for most apps.

You can also build an extension-only app, which is an app that contains no [app home](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/admin), and uses the extension-only template. To create an extension-only app, select **Build an extension-only app** when you create your app. [Learn more about extension-only apps](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/app-extensions/build-extension-only-app).

To learn more about building using the template, and deploying apps built using the template, review the readme in the template repository.
