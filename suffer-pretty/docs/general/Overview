# Overview

You can enable certain Shopify features or add functionality to a theme. If you're building a theme for a client, or for your own store, then you can pick and choose from these features. If you're building a theme for the Shopify Theme Store, then some of these features [need to be included](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/store/requirements#features) in your theme.

Features fall into the following categories:

* [Product merchandising](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/product-merchandising)
