    Uploads the current theme as the specified theme, or a [development theme](/docs/themes/tools/cli#development-themes), to a store so you can preview it.

  This command returns the following information:


  - A link to your development theme at http://127.0.0.1:9292. This URL can hot
  reload local changes to CSS and sections, or refresh the entire page when a
  file changes, enabling you to preview changes in real time using the store's
  data.

    You can specify a different network interface and port using `--host` and `--port`.

  - A link to the [editor](/docs/themes/tools/online-editor) for the theme in
  the Shopify admin.


  - A [preview
  link](https://help.shopify.com/manual/online-store/themes/adding-themes#share-a-theme-preview-with-others)
  that you can share with other developers.


  If you already have a development theme for your current environment, then
  this command replaces the development theme with your local theme. You can
  override this using the `--theme-editor-sync` flag.


  > Note: You can't preview checkout customizations using http://127.0.0.1:9292.


  Development themes are deleted when you run `shopify auth logout`. If you need
  a preview link that can be used after you log out, then you should
  [share](/docs/api/shopify-cli/theme/theme-share) your theme or
  [push](/docs/api/shopify-cli/theme/theme-push) to an unpublished theme on your
  store.


  You can run this command only in a directory that matches the [default Shopify
  theme folder structure](/docs/themes/tools/cli#directory-structure).
