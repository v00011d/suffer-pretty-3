  If you want to duplicate your local theme, you need to run `shopify theme
  push` first.


  If no theme ID is specified, you're prompted to select the theme that you want
  to duplicate from the list of themes in your store. You're asked to confirm
  that you want to duplicate the specified theme.


  Prompts and confirmations are not shown when duplicate is run in a CI
  environment or the `--force` flag is used, therefore you must specify a theme
  ID using the `--theme` flag.


  You can optionally name the duplicated theme using the `--name` flag.


  If you use the `--json` flag, then theme information is returned in JSON
  format, which can be used as a machine-readable input for scripts or
  continuous integration.


  Sample JSON output:


  ```json

  {
    "theme": {
      "id": 108267175958,
      "name": "A Duplicated Theme",
      "role": "unpublished",
      "shop": "mystore.myshopify.com"
    }
  }

  ```


  ```json

  {
    "message": "The theme 'Summer Edition' could not be duplicated due to errors",
    "errors": ["Maximum number of themes reached"],
    "requestId": "12345-abcde-67890"
  }
