# Apps in checkout

Merchants use [Shopify checkout](https://help.shopify.com/manual/checkout-settings) to accept orders and receive payments wherever they sell online. To augment Shopify checkout with new functionality, build an app with extensions.

***

## How it works

After a customer adds products to a cart, they use Shopify checkout to enter their customer, shipping, and payment information before placing the order.

To extend checkout, apps can use extensions. For example, apps can use extensions to offer a customer free shipping or other discounts, depending on the contents of their cart.

To install apps on their store, merchants can use the Shopify admin. There, they can can use the [checkout editor](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/checkout/test-checkout-ui-extensions#test-the-extension-in-the-checkout-editor) to place a block for a [checkout UI extension](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/checkout-ui-extensions) in the checkout experience.

## Customization options

There are various types of Shopify Extensions that you can use to customize checkout:

* UI extensions
* Functions
* Web pixel extensions
* Payments extensions

All customization options are easy to install and upgrade-safe, enabling merchants to benefit from Shopify releases new products such as [Shop Pay](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/checkout/test-checkout-ui-extensions#test-with-shop-pay), or features such as [One-page checkout](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/checkout/test-checkout-ui-extensions#one-page-checkout).

For a detailed breakdown of the technologies that can be used to customize checkout, and the ways that you can extend checkout, refer to the [options for customizing Shopify checkout](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/checkout/technologies).

Note

Checkout apps and extensions have [design requirements](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/app-requirements-checklist#design-requirements-for-checkout-apps) that apply to custom apps as well as public apps. Be sure that your app meets [all requirements](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/app-requirements-checklist) for its functionality and distribution type.

## Upgrade

Deprecated

`checkout.liquid` is now unsupported for the Information, Shipping, and Payment checkout steps. `checkout.liquid`, additional scripts, and script tags are deprecated for the **Thank you** and **Order status** pages and will be sunset on August 28, 2025.

Stores that currently use `checkout.liquid` for the **Thank you** and **Order status** pages need to [upgrade to Shopify Extensions in Checkout](https://www.shopify.com/checkout#advanced-customizations) before the deadline.

[Shopify Scripts](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid/objects#script) will continue to work alongside Shopify Extensions in checkout until June 30, 2026.

A report identifying your current checkout customizations is available in the Shopify admin. The report provides high-level guidance to map customizations to Shopify Extensions in Checkout. Use this report to simplify your review of your existing customizations and to help you upgrade to Shopify Extensions in Checkout faster. [Learn more](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/checkout-settings/checkout-extensibility/checkout-upgrade).

To upgrade a `checkout.liquid` customization to Shopify Extensions in Checkout, take one or more of the following actions:

1. Use a public app that's built using extensions.

   We're adding new checkout apps to the Shopify App Store on a regular basis. If there currently isn't a suitable public app for your customization, then consider simplifying your checkout temporarily and adding new apps to your store as they become available.

2. Build a custom app using extensions, or [hire a service partner](https://www.shopify.com/plus/partners/service?type=service\&services%5B%5D=141) to build one for you.

In some cases, after you've upgraded you can [revert to `checkout.liquid`](https://help.shopify.com/manual/checkout-settings/checkout-extensibility/checkout-upgrade#revert-to-checkout-liquid) until its sunset dates.

If you're upgrading a store to Shopify Extensions in Checkout, we recommend planning your in-checkout, **Thank you** page, and **Order status** page upgrades together, when possible, for the following benefits:

* Avoid maintaining multiple tech stacks, like UI extensions and `checkout.liquid`.

* Apply styling once to the entire experience.

* Manage one sunset date for `checkout.liquid` rather than one date for pre-purchase pages and another for **Thank you** and **Order status** pages.

  If this isn't possible, then we recommend prioritizing the upgrade for in-checkout pages first and upgrading after-purchase pages after that.
